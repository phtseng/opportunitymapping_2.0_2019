# Opportunity Mapping Code Review - Final Changes

Hi Arthur,

Thank you so much for going through all of these changes and providing edits to them. These are extremely helpful suggestions and edits, so I wanted to let you know what I was able to review and improve based on your list.

## File Organization

I followed your instructions carefully in terms of where and how to download the data directory so that all the scripts will end up in the original/same folder. The R project definitely made this process a lot easier and organized.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
